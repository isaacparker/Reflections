What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

init creates a metadata file called .git that will carry all your commit information.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where the commits are tracked. You have to add files to the staging area for a depository to have a proper history. The working directory is simply the directory where all your files for your project are kept, where not every file is has to be necessarily involved on the staging area.
