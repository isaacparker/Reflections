What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

init creates a metadata file called .git that will carry all your commit information.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where the commits are tracked. You have to add files to the staging area for a depository to have a proper history. The working directory is simply the directory where all your files for your project are kept, where not every file is has to be necessarily involved on the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can add a file to the staging area after modifying it, then commit it to the repo.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

merging updates the master with a branches changes.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
The pros are git is smart enough to merge branches that don't have conflicts on the same lines of code thus saving time and frustration over tracking and looking for differences in the code.

The cons are git doesn't always know what to do if the same bit of code is changed by the two parties, so you have to contact the person and resolve the code manually. Doing it manually assures that the code stays clean and keeps git from making weird/ false merges to the code.
